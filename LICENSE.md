# Licenses

This code is two kinds of licenses: open-source and commercial

## Open source license

The open source license is designed for open source and personal projects. The open source license is [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). The GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important is how [it is sticky when you distribute your work publicly](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#section5). From the [GPL FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic):

If you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL.

Releasing your project that uses this code under the GPLv3, in turn, requires your project to be licensed under the GPLv3. If you are okay with this, feel free to use this code under the GPLv3, without purchasing a commercial license.

## Commercial license

The commercial license is designed to for you to use Isotope in commercial products and applications, without the provisions of the GPLv3. With the commercial license, your code is kept propietary, to yourself. If you want to use Isotope to develop commercial sites, themes, projects, and applications, the commercial license is the appropriate license.

If you are interested in purchasing a commercial license please drop us a line through out [homepage's contact form]("https://www.flexify.net").
